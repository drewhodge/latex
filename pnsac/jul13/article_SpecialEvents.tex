A two week break of the restoration of the aircraft will occur in

On Wednesday, August 14th, PNSAC will have its third annual golf day
at the beautiful Loch March golf course starting at 10:00 A.M. with a
nine minute separation between flights.  The format for the 18 holes
will be a best ball game.
 
The club house at Loch March has an excellent breakfast menu so to
make your day more enjoyable it is recommended we meet for breakfast

given us two 18 hole passes for the winner of longest drive and
closest to the pin.

\section{Montreal Area Control Centre and the Bombardier Aerospace  --
Friday Otober 4, 2013}
\label{sec:montreal}

Our Third planned Special Event, on Friday October 4th, is a trip to
the Montreal Area Control Centre and the Bombardier Aerospace factory
in Dorval.

The Montreal Area Control Centre is a secure facility responsible for
Radar Air Traffic Control in the Quebec region including northern
Labrador up to Baffin Island. This tour will have us divided into
smaller groups due to the requirement for quiet so as not to disturb
the Air Traffic Controllers. For operational considerations this tour
could be cancelled on short notice if there is a declared emergency or
an emergency in progress.

After a lunch break we will travel to the Bombardier factory in Dorval
where the CRJ series jet aircraft are built.

For dinner we will proceed to the Willow Inn in Hudson before
proceeding back to Ottawa.

As this tour is now sold out we can accept bookings on a cancellation
basis only.
