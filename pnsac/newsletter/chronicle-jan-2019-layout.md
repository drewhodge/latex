3. President's Notes-attached
4. Conservator's Corner-attached.
5. Our Members-attached

**NB** Would it be possible to add to the front page above the editor's notes,
the following:

Celebrating the 70th Anniversary of the First Canadian Non-stop Transcontinental
Flight

You will have a better idea of what font and pitch to use as you put the edition
together.  

**NB** With respect to item number 6, this is the Citizen article. I understand
that you are able to copy the text into a format suitable for the Chronicle but
there is some issue as to whether you can incorporate the photo. I would also
ask you to  include prior to the article the following introduction in italics

The following article was published in the Ottawa Citizen on February 1, 2003
under the byline of Randall Denley. It was brought to our attention recently by
Drew Hodge. The article is republished with the express permission of the Ottawa
Citizen, a division of Postmedia Network Inc. (ed.).

**NB** With respect to item 7 these are the dates:

- Saturday, January 19, 2019 Members Meeting & 70th anniversary events
- Saturday, April 13, 2019 Annual General Meeting
- Saturday-Sunday, June 1, 2, 2019 Doors Open Ottawa (Tentative Event)
- Monday, July 1, 2019 Canada Day

I am waiting to hear back from Bruce G. if there are any recent photos we can
incorporate into this edition. I am also looking for a photo of the 70th
anniversary aircraft.
