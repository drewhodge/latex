\maketitle

Since the last issue of the NStar Chronicle in March of this year we
have continued to reorganize our volunteer operations under the
leadership of the Museum's Special Projects Manager, R\'{e}jean (Rej)
Demers. We have started a recruitment process for new restoration
volunteers and to date two new people have started work. During the
summer two more permanent Museum staff joined Rej to replace people who
have retired. It is obviously taking time for the new Museum staff to
get to know the complex operations of the Aviation Museum, to get to
know the Project North Star volunteers and assess their various talents
and areas of expertise. Consequently, our summer has been quiet but
steadily productive.

For several reasons it became necessary to reorganize the location of
several major Museum artifacts. This affected the North Star aircraft
which spent the summer outside the Reserve Hanger resulting in some
problems with water ingress and further bird activity. I am pleased to
say that the aircraft is now back inside the hangar.

The Museum is actively supporting Project North Star and trying to
facilitate our restoration work wherever possible and is promoting our
work and future activities. Our Treasurer, Paul Labranche, and I
recently met with the Museum Foundation. The Foundation is the umbrella
organization with responsibility for fundraising and business
development at the three museums, comprising the Museum Corporation,
(Aviation, Science \& Tech and Agriculture). We had a very productive
meeting, which among other things has resulted in the Foundation
deciding to highlight Project North Star in its Fall fundraising mail
out. This type of collaboration is very good for our Association and we
hope as good for the Foundation.

Our biggest challenge at present is to get our website properly
operational again. A couple of our volunteers with website knowledge
have indicated a willingness to do the necessary work and we are hoping
to have the site working and up to date in the near future.

On December 2nd we held a Members' meeting at the Museum when we were
fortunate to have Jim Mason join us to talk about the restoration of an
early Lockheed aircraft flown by TCA. The meeting was well attended in
a new venue of the Avro Arrow room instead of the Bush Theatre.
Following Jim's interesting presentation, the group moved to the
Museum's Restoration Hangar where Rej talked about the progress of the
North Star restoration and the plans for work in 2018.

One of the initiatives currently underway is to create a visual
timeline of the work already completed on the North Star restoration
and the planned future work to bring the project to completion. It is
anticipated that this visual timeline will be mounted on a display
board for our members and the public to view.

In closing, I am optimistic that 2018 will see increased activity both
in the aircraft restoration work and also within our Association.
