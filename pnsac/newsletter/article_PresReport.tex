\title{Notes from the President}
\author{Richard Lodge}

\maketitle

It is a year since I last wrote Notes from the President for the NStar Chronicle. During this time there have been many changes within the Project North Star Association. 

In my last Notes, I referred to the temporary closure of restoration work by PNSAC volunteers on 
the North Star. We effectively did not restart operations until the middle of last year which 
resulted in a considerable loss of momentum for the Association as a whole together with the 
resignation of some of our directors and officers.

Last November we held our Annual General Meeting, which will in future be held in the Fall rather 
than in the summer when many of our members are on vacation. At this AGM two new directors were 
elected to replace two out of the three directors who had resigned.

We were very happy to welcome Roger Button and Phil Chrysler as new directors. Roger has been our corporate secretary. Phil has been our merchandise manager for several years and has also acted as assistant treasurer to the Association. 

Drew Hodge, our long time NStar Chronicle publisher and webmaster, has after ten years, decided 
that he would like to spend more time on his other interests and did not stand for re-election as a director. Drew will continue to publish the NStar Chronicle and we are very pleased to 
welcome Garth Pyper as our new webmaster. 

Bill Tate has been our vice president and  highly regarded special events coordinator for several years but decided that it was time to hand over to someone else. 

Bruce Grant, who has ably editor the NS Chronicle for several years, also decided not to continue as a director and officer. Roger has agreed to take over the editor's  job where I am expecting that his word smithing abilities as a lawyer will come in handy.

The table officers of the Association  are now:  myself as president; Bruce Gemmill ,our senior project manager, as vice president; Roger  as secretary; and Paul Labranche as treasurer. 

While the changes have been taking place with the executive of the Association, work has continued with our main reason for being; the restoration of the North Star. Elsewhere in this issue you will find a progress report on the work on the aircraft which as always is being done to a very high standard.

The North Star restoration project, now in its twelve year, will shortly be entering a new phase. 
Work on the fourth engine will be complete in a few months and we are now reworking our work plan 
for the restoration as a whole, in conjunction with the conservation professionals at Museum. In 
a future issue of the NStar Chronicle we hope to provide members with the broad outline of the 
updated work plan, together with anticipated time scales and funding requirements. Since the Museum does not receive government funds for the North Star restoration, future major work on the aircraft will have to be financed by donations from members and other people interested in preserving a plane which contributed so much to Canada?s military transportation needs in the late 1940s through to the early 1960s.

During the summer we hope to have two major displays of the North Star for Association members and the general public. The first will be during the weekend of June 6/7 when we will be taking part in Doors Open Ottawa and the second will be our usual display on Canada Day. As always, Association members will be particularly welcome at these displays and will be able to see the results of the excellent work being done by the volunteers on the plane.
