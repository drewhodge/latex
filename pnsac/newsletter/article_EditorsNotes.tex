Our readers will appreciate from the articles and photographs in this edition that real progress
being made on the restoration of the aircraft. A number of new restoration volunteers have signed on this year bringing with them diverse skills and experience. Whoever thought that someone with a mountain climbing background would be able to put his special skills to work on an aircraft. Believe it or not but see the "Conservator's Corner."  As I have previously commented: When work on the aircraft is moving ahead it encourages enthusiasm at all levels of the organization. One of the biggest cheerleaders of our Association is its president, Richard Lodge. Richard wears many hats including that of a restoration volunteer so he knows of what he speaks.  In this edition Richard discusses how he came to be involved in Project North Star and joins the illustrious members of the Association who have contributed to "Our Members" column.  But I would be remiss if I didn't thank all of our contributors to this edition including our publisher Drew Hodge.
