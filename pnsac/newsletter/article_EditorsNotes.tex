As the President has noted the Association has, through its volunteers,
expended thousands of hours on the North Star's restoration since 2004. In the
last couple of years, however, various developments at CASM have resulted in a
diminution in the amount of restoration work we have been able to do. The result
has been a decline in the number of volunteers working on the aircraft, and a
corresponding decline in our membership. This in turn has led to an overall
decline in the Association's activities, including the publication of this
newsletter. CASM has made some major changes to its personnel, including those
directly responsible for the restoration of the North Star. The Association is
already experiencing a positive change in its relationship with the Museum which
can only be to the good. We look forward to a renewed partnership with CASM to
our mutual benefit.
