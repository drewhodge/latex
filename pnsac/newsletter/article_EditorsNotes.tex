Our Association was incorporated in 2003. We are fortunate that a
number of the original members of the organization, such as Tim
Timmins, are still involved as they can provide an historical
perspective. As Tim says, in the article "Our Members," there have been
many bumps in the road, and the fact that the aircraft is still a long
way from completion after 16 years speaks for itself. In January 2017,
R\'{e}jean (Rej) Demers took up his position as CASM's Conservation Project
Manager. Rej's first contribution to the Chronicle can be found in the
"Conservator's Corner." The restoration of the North Star is a priority
for Rej. He has spent the first year of his mandate gathering
information and developing systems and procedures which will, in the
long run, move the restoration of the aircraft forward in a coherent
manner. I have previously stated the obvious and that is the health and
vigour of the Association is dependent on the restoration status of the
aircraft. In the last few years there have been as many bumps in the
road as there are potholes in Ottawa in the spring. The President is
very optimistic we have reached a real turning point (see the
"President's Notes") and wouldn't that be great.
