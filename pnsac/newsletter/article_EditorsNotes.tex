This past year started off as a repeat of the difficult year the
Association experienced in 2014. Consequently there was little news
and less enthusiasm for publishing the Chronicle on any regular
basis. However, as a result of changes to the management of the museum
organization there is a renewed sense of hope that we will be able to
move forward in 2016, as expressed in the Notes from the
President. One of those changes is the appointment of Chris Kitzan as
the new director general of CASM. You will find a message from Chris
in this edition. Chris and his boss Alex Benay, the CEO of the museum
corporation, are enthusiastic supporters of our organization. We are also
commencing a new feature highlighting the members of our Association
and starting off with Bruce Gemmill, our Project Manager. In addition,
we are adding a "Miscellany" feature which lists items of interest to
our members. If any of our readers wish to contribute an article, have
suggestions for future articles, have suggestions for the "Miscellany"
feature, or have any comments about the Chronicle please let me know.
