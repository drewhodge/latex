This issue of the Chronicle carries the last of four chapters in
Richard Lodge's story of his time at Rolls-Royce. Taken together, they
make an interesting ethnology of an extinct industrial culture. The
whole series is accessible through our website,
{\color{blue}\texttt{\url{http://www.projectnorthstar.ca}}} (note that
the location of the neswletter archive will change when the new
website goes live) starting with the April 2013 issue of the
Chronicle.

We also have another hair-raising flying story from Tim Timmins. A
series of previous Timmins stories can be found through the same
website, starting with the December 2010 issue.

Motorheads among our readers should look into Ted Devey's extensive
writings on the Rolls-Royce Merlin, starting in the December 2006
issue.

All together, the archived issues are a valuable web resource for
readers with an interest in aviation history or the history of Project
North Star.
