# Images for Chronicle January 2019

## From Roger

Since there is no article dealing specifically with the restoration perhaps you
could do a separate photo page as you did for the tail removal in the last
edition.

Can you work with this photo [from Rej]? It could go in two places I would
think. Either with the front page banner or my article on the flight.  

## From Bruce

Here are 3 photos of work on the wall and floor panels.  All the wall panels
needed to be replaced.  We are able to save some of the floor panels, but not
the one shown which was in front of the cargo door so was heavily damaged by
cargo and exposure to the weather.  The fourth photo is the rotating beacon on
the top of the fuselage.  It was removed for restoration and to stop a
persistent leak.
